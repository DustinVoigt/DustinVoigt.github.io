<h3><p> Written Response </p></h3>

<h3><p> Short Story </p></h3> 
<h4><p>Once upon a time in a mythical land called Midgard there was an elf named Siegfried. They lived in peace and quiet until one day a volcano erupted and then elders told Siegfried that once the volcano erupts, Surtr, the evil fire giant, will awaken. The only way to stop Surtr is by acquiring the Shard Of Pure Cold on top of the mountain called The Frozen Peak in Jotunheim and dropping it in the volcano, Mt. Vesuvius, to quell him. On the way to gather the shard from The Frozen Peak he doesn't realize he has to face many different obstacles throughout his journey. Siegfried must recruit a team to help him retrieve the Shard of Pure Cold from The Frozen Peak. Jotunheim, the region in which Mt. Doom is located, lies far to the South, across a vast ocean. Siegfried needs to search for someone to take him across the ocean but finds none brave enough to make the journey. While searching he hears of a brave sailor and warrior who can allegedly read the waves. His name is Odysseus and resides in the island nation of Ithaca. Seigfreid travels to Ithaca to recruit Odysseus. After a quick battle to prove his worth and determination, Odysseus agrees to join Siegfried in search of the Shard. After they pack and start to set out for their journey just before they get ready to leave, a mage named Merlin runs down to the beach and yells wait for me. In order for you guys to acquire the Shard of Cold you must fight Surtrâ€™s servant, a Dragonoid named Fafnir. The only way you guys can defeat him is if you have a wizard like me. Siegfried and Odysseus have a very intense meeting whether or not they should allow him to come. After they talk they finally allow him to come and they begin to set sail. On there way to The Frozen Peak they are forced to cross treacherous seas and dangerous sea monsters. After they cross the seas they finally arrive at The Frozen Peak and begin the dangerous climb towards the top of the mountain where they will soon come face to face with Fafnir. On there way up the mountain they experience freezing blizzards and extreme icy cold temperatures until they arrive at the top. When they get to the top they find themselves face to face with Fafnir. They begin to confront Fafnir and after a long, grueling battle they kill Fafnir and acquire the Shard Of Pure Cold. On there way back from getting the Shard the must climb Mt. Vesuvius. While climbing there are giant flaming fireballs being thrown out of the volcano down towards them and they realize they have to act fast before they die. As there going up the volcano they finally reach the top and begin to quell Surtr. They drop the Shard Of Pure Cold in the volcano and slowly and suddenly the volcano is quenched and everything is ok for another 100 years.</p></h4>
