     <h3><p> Video Narration</p></h3>
     <h4><p>The video starts off with the person typing in Hangman(). The person then starts guessing random letters, and they are able to see the ones they have guessed through the list at the bottom each time they guess. The person guesses all of the letters in the word and is met with a rewarding message that exits out of the code. In the second time the program is run, the person types in all incorrect letters and is met with a "You Lost" message.</p></h4>
     <h3><p> Written Response </p></h3>
     <h4><p> Our program was to create a hangman game where there computer chooses a word and the player has 6 lives to guess the word or else he/she loses. One difficulty I had was getting the program to keep track of the lives the players had. Everytime the player would lose a life the program would take away all the players lives thus causing the game to end on the first turn. The way we fixed it was by recoding the While loop but leaving the code to track the players life out of it. At one point I had the opportunity to understand and create a function that integrates another function. In hangman we had the secret (The word chosen by the program) call the while loop to start the game stating that the program is ready for the player to start guessing. The player lives counter was also subtracting double the amount of lives it was supposed to do. I was able to complete this independently by removing the code out of the while loop and replacing it below the while loop so it would get repeated twice or more times.</p></h4>
